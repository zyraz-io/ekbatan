# Sharding

Sharding is opt-in and has zero overhead when disabled. Single-database deployments can ignore this page entirely. When you need to scale writes horizontally — or when policy forces data to live on specific infrastructure — Ekbatan gives you a two-level addressing scheme, self-describing IDs, and shard-aware repositories without changing your action or model code.

## Two axes: group + member

A `ShardIdentifier` is a numeric `(group, member)` pair:

- **Group** — a *policy axis*. Boundaries forced on you from the outside. Regulatory residency ("Mexico data stays in Mexico"), tenant isolation contracts, business-domain separation. Group cardinality is driven by external constraints; you don't choose how many. 8 bits, up to 256 groups.
- **Member** — a *performance axis*. Horizontal scaling within a single policy boundary. You add members when one database can't handle the write throughput. Member cardinality is driven by capacity planning. 6 bits, up to 64 members per group.

Naturally, members of the same group share network locality and failure domain (same region, VPC, availability zone). Cross-member queries within a group are scatter-gather across every member, so intra-group latency directly affects them. Names like `global-eu-1`, `global-eu-2`, `global-eu-3` reflect this convention. The framework doesn't enforce it — JDBC URLs are opaque to it — but it's the shape the design assumes.

```java
public static final ShardIdentifier GLOBAL_SHARD  = ShardIdentifier.of(0, 0);
public static final ShardIdentifier MEXICO_SHARD  = ShardIdentifier.of(1, 0);
public static final ShardIdentifier MEXICO_2      = ShardIdentifier.of(1, 1);
```

`ShardIdentifier.DEFAULT == ShardIdentifier.of(0, 0)`. Unregistered shards fall back to the default — see [`DatabaseRegistry.effectiveShard`](#unregistered-shards-fall-back-to-default) below.

## Self-describing IDs: `ShardedUUID`

`ShardedUUID` is a UUID v7 with the shard's `(group, member)` bits embedded inside `rand_b`:

```
ShardedUUID
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MSB: [48-bit timestamp][4-bit version=7][12-bit rand_a]      │
│ LSB: [2-bit variant][8-bit GROUP][6-bit MEMBER][48-bit rand] │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The shard can be recovered from the ID at any time without a lookup table:

```java
ShardedId<Wallet> id = ShardedId.generate(Wallet.class, MEXICO_SHARD);
ShardIdentifier shard = id.resolveShardIdentifier();   // group=1, member=0
```

Domain entity IDs use `ShardedId<T>`. Event IDs (`eventlog.events.id`) stay as regular UUIDs — events are co-located with their model and don't need independent shard routing.

## Sharded models

A model that participates in sharding declares its ID type as `ShardedId<T>` instead of `Id<T>`:

```java
@AutoBuilder
public final class Wallet extends Model<Wallet, ShardedId<Wallet>, WalletState> {

    public final UUID ownerId;
    public final Currency currency;
    public final BigDecimal balance;

    Wallet(WalletBuilder builder) {
        super(builder);
        this.ownerId  = Validate.notNull(builder.ownerId,  "ownerId cannot be null");
        this.currency = Validate.notNull(builder.currency, "currency cannot be null");
        this.balance  = Validate.notNull(builder.balance,  "balance cannot be null");
    }

    public static WalletBuilder createWallet(
            ShardIdentifier shard, UUID ownerId, Currency currency, BigDecimal balance, Instant now) {
        final var id = ShardedId.generate(Wallet.class, shard);   // shard bits encoded into the UUID
        return WalletBuilder.wallet()
                .id(id)
                .state(OPENED)
                .ownerId(ownerId)
                .currency(currency)
                .balance(balance)
                .createdDate(now)
                .withInitialVersion()
                .withEvent(new WalletCreatedEvent(id, ownerId, currency, balance));
    }

    @Override
    public WalletBuilder copy() {
        return WalletBuilder.wallet()
                .copyBase(this)
                .ownerId(ownerId)
                .currency(currency)
                .balance(balance);
    }

    public Wallet deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
        Validate.isTrue(amount.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) > 0, "Deposit amount must be positive");
        final var newBalance = balance.add(amount);
        return copy()
                .withEvent(new WalletMoneyDepositedEvent(id, amount, newBalance))
                .balance(newBalance)
                .build();
    }
}
```

The shard is chosen *at creation time*, typically inside an Action that maps business input to a shard:

```java
@EkbatanAction
public class WalletCreateAction extends Action<WalletCreateAction.Params, Wallet> {

    public record Params(String countryCode, UUID ownerId, Currency currency, BigDecimal balance) {}

    @Override
    protected Wallet perform(Principal principal, Params params) {
        var shard = switch (params.countryCode()) {
            case "MX" -> MEXICO_SHARD;
            case "AU" -> AUSTRALIA_SHARD;
            default   -> GLOBAL_SHARD;
        };
        var wallet = createWallet(shard, params.ownerId(), params.currency(), params.balance(), clock.instant()).build();
        return plan().add(wallet);
    }
}
```

After this, the shard travels with the wallet's ID. Every subsequent read or update finds its way back to the correct database without any explicit shard parameter.

## Sharded repositories

Opt the repository into sharding by passing a `ShardingStrategy` to `super(...)`. The bundled `EmbeddedBitsShardingStrategy` decodes the shard from the UUID's embedded bits:

```java
@EkbatanRepository
public class WalletRepository extends ModelRepository<Wallet, WalletsRecord, Wallets, UUID> {

    public WalletRepository(DatabaseRegistry databaseRegistry) {
        super(Wallet.class, WALLETS, WALLETS.ID, databaseRegistry, new EmbeddedBitsShardingStrategy());
    }

    @Override
    public Wallet fromRecord(WalletsRecord record) {
        return WalletBuilder.wallet()
                .id(ShardedId.of(Wallet.class, ShardedUUID.from(record.getId())))   // ← only repo line that differs from a non-sharded repo
                .version(record.getVersion())
                .state(WalletState.valueOf(record.getState()))
                .ownerId(record.getOwnerId())
                .currency(Currency.getInstance(record.getCurrency()))
                .balance(record.getBalance())
                .createdDate(record.getCreatedDate())
                .updatedDate(record.getUpdatedDate())
                .build();
    }

    @Override
    public WalletsRecord toRecord(Wallet w) {
        return new WalletsRecord(
                w.id.getValue().value(), w.version, w.state.name(),
                w.ownerId, w.currency.getCurrencyCode(), w.balance,
                w.createdDate, w.updatedDate);
    }
}
```

With the strategy in place, all CRUD methods route automatically:

```java
walletRepository.findById(walletId);      // routes to the wallet's shard (decoded from the ID)
walletRepository.update(updatedWallet);   // routes to the wallet's shard
walletRepository.findAllByIds(ids);       // groups IDs by shard, queries each shard once
walletRepository.findAll();               // scatter-gathers across all shards
```

Custom queries that drop into raw JOOQ can target a specific shard using the ID-aware accessors:

```java
public List<Wallet> findAllByOwnerOnSameShardAs(ShardedId<Wallet> walletId, UUID ownerId) {
    return readonlyDb(walletId.getValue())            // routes to the wallet's shard
            .selectFrom(WALLETS)
            .where(WALLETS.OWNER_ID.eq(ownerId))
            .fetch(this::fromRecord);
}
```

The same accessors come in `db(id)`, `txDb(id)`, and `txDbElseDb(id)` flavors, plus `db(persistable)` / `txDb(persistable)` overloads when the full domain object is on hand instead of the raw ID. To run a query against *every* shard, `dbs()` and `readonlyDbs()` return the full collection of `DSLContext`s.

## Custom sharding strategies

`EmbeddedBitsShardingStrategy` is the default, and most applications can use it as-is. A custom `ShardingStrategy` is only needed when the bundled default does not match the domain model. For example:

- **Column-based** — the shard is derived from a non-ID column on the entity (country code, tenant ID, region).
- **Hash-based** — hash one or more columns and modulo by the member count.
- **Range-based** — partition by ID ranges (e.g. wallets `0..1M` on shard A, `1M..2M` on shard B).
- **Lookup-table** — read the shard mapping from a separate table or external config service.

The interface has three methods:

```java
public interface ShardingStrategy<DB_ID> {
    boolean usesShardAwareId();
    Optional<ShardIdentifier> resolveShardIdentifierById(DB_ID id);
    Optional<ShardIdentifier> resolveShardIdentifier(Persistable<?> persistable);
}
```

A column-based example that routes by a country code:

```java
public final class CountryCodeShardingStrategy implements ShardingStrategy<UUID> {

    @Override public boolean usesShardAwareId() { return false; }   // raw UUIDs do not encode the shard

    @Override
    public Optional<ShardIdentifier> resolveShardIdentifierById(UUID id) {
        return Optional.empty();   // the ID alone is not enough
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<ShardIdentifier> resolveShardIdentifier(Persistable<?> p) {
        if (p instanceof CountryAware ca) {
            return Optional.of(switch (ca.countryCode()) {
                case "MX" -> ShardIdentifier.of(1, 0);
                case "AU" -> ShardIdentifier.of(2, 0);
                default   -> ShardIdentifier.of(0, 0);
            });
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
```

When `usesShardAwareId()` returns `false`, ID-only methods like `findById(id)` are rejected — without inspecting the entity, the framework cannot know which shard to query. In that case, use condition-based reads (`findAllWhere`, `findOneWhere`) which scatter-gather across all shards, or work from the persistable directly via `db(persistable)` / `txDb(persistable)` in custom queries.

## Declarative configuration

Rather than wiring `TransactionManager`s by hand, describe the shard topology as a YAML tree and feed it to `DatabaseRegistry.fromConfig(config)`:

```yaml
sharding:
  default-shard:
    group: 0
    member: 0

  groups:
    - group: 0
      name: global
      members:
        - member: 0
          name: global-eu-1
          configs:
            primary-config:                # required
              jdbc-url: jdbc:postgresql://global-eu-1-rw.example.com:5432/wallets
              username: wallets_app
              password: ${EU_1_PASSWORD}
              maximum-pool-size: 20
              leak-detection-threshold: 30000
            secondary-config:              # optional, but encouraged
              jdbc-url: jdbc:postgresql://global-eu-1-ro.example.com:5432/wallets
              username: wallets_app_ro
              password: ${EU_1_RO_PASSWORD}
              maximum-pool-size: 20
            lock-config:                   # user-defined; consumed by your own code
              jdbc-url: jdbc:postgresql://global-eu-1-rw.example.com:5432/wallets
              username: wallets_lock
              password: ${EU_1_LOCK_PASSWORD}
              maximum-pool-size: 50
              leak-detection-threshold: 0   # locks may sit idle while held; disable

        - member: 1
          name: global-eu-2
          configs:
            primary-config: { … }
            secondary-config: { … }

    - group: 1
      name: mexico
      members:
        - member: 0
          name: mexico-cdmx-1
          configs:
            primary-config: { … }
            secondary-config: { … }
```

About the `configs:` map of each member:

- The examples use **kebab-case**, the canonical convention for Spring, Quarkus, and Micronaut. All three integrations also accept **camelCase** (`default-shard` / `defaultShard`, `primary-config` / `primaryConfig`, `jdbc-url` / `jdbcUrl`) and you can mix the two within one file; keys are normalised before binding.
- **`primary-config` / `primaryConfig` is required.** Every member must have one; missing it fails the build at startup.
- **`secondary-config` / `secondaryConfig` is optional but encouraged.** If absent, non-transactional reads transparently fall back to the primary pool. If present, they go to the replica, offloading primary.
- **Any other named entry is user-defined.** `jobs-config` / `jobsConfig`, `lock-config` / `lockConfig`, `analytics-config` / `analyticsConfig`, etc. are equivalent in external config. After binding, the internal Java map key is always camelCase, so code must use `member.configFor("jobsConfig")`, `member.configFor("lockConfig")`, etc. Do not pass kebab-case to `configFor(...)`.

```java
ShardMemberConfig member = …;
DataSourceConfig  primary   = member.primaryConfig();                  // required, non-null
Optional<DataSourceConfig> secondary = member.secondaryConfig();       // empty if absent
Optional<DataSourceConfig> lock      = member.configFor("lockConfig"); // user-defined
```

## Unregistered shards fall back to default

`DatabaseRegistry.effectiveShard(shard)` quietly returns the default shard for any `ShardIdentifier` not explicitly registered. So a wallet routed to an Australia shard that hasn't been deployed yet will fall through to the default. This makes incremental rollouts safe — encode the future shard in IDs first, register the database later, no migration needed in between.

## Cross-shard actions

Cross-shard actions are **rejected by default**. If an action plans changes that span shards, the executor throws `CrossShardException`. Opt in per call:

```java
var config = ExecutionConfiguration.Builder.executionConfiguration()
        .allowCrossShard(true)
        .build();

executor.execute(principal, MyAction.class, params, config);
```

When enabled, each involved shard gets its own transaction, and the action's row in `eventlog.events` is duplicated to every shard with the same UUID so each shard contains the full action context.

This is **not 2PC**. Each shard commits independently — partial failures are possible. The cross-shard switch is opt-in for that reason; treat it as an escape hatch and pick it consciously only when the operation is genuinely cross-region/cross-tenant and you've designed your domain to be eventually consistent.

Prefer the per-call override so the risk is visible at the call site. Use an executor default only for a dedicated executor whose actions are all designed for per-shard commits. If partial commits would require compensation, use a [saga](../concepts/sagas.md) instead of one cross-shard action.

## What sharding does not provide

- **Cross-shard foreign keys.** Each shard is a self-contained schema.
- **Offset/limit pagination.** Doesn't work correctly across shards. Use cursor-based (keyset / temporal) pagination in concrete repository subclasses.
- **Distributed transactions.** No 2PC. Each shard commits independently.
