# Distributed background jobs

For periodic background work that should run on **a single** instance across a cluster — daily reports, hourly cleanups, periodic reconciliation — Ekbatan ships `JobRegistry` in the `ekbatan-distributed-jobs` module. It's a thin, opinionated facade over [db-scheduler](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler) that handles the tricky parts (atomic claim across instances, heartbeat-based crash recovery, graceful shutdown, per-task virtual-thread workers) while keeping the user-facing API tiny.

## Defining a job

Extend `DistributedJob`:

```java
@EkbatanDistributedJob
public class DailyReportJob extends DistributedJob {

    private final ReportService reportService;

    public DailyReportJob(ReportService reportService) {
        this.reportService = reportService;
    }

    @Override public String name() {
        return "daily-report";        // cluster-wide unique
    }

    @Override public Schedule schedule() {
        return Schedules.daily(LocalTime.of(2, 0));
    }

    @Override public void execute(ExecutionContext ctx) {
        reportService.generateAndSend();
    }
}
```

`Schedule` is db-scheduler's interface, so any of its implementations work directly: `FixedDelay`, `FixedRate`, `Cron`, `Daily`, etc.

The `@EkbatanDistributedJob` annotation marks the class for discovery by the DI integrations (Spring Boot, Quarkus, Micronaut). Without DI, register the job manually — see [Wiring without DI](#wiring-without-di) below.

## Coordination semantics (inherited from db-scheduler)

- Every instance polls the shared `scheduled_tasks` table.
- When a task's `execution_time` arrives, exactly one instance wins the atomic claim per scheduled slot — that instance runs it.
- Each running instance heartbeats periodically. If a heartbeat goes stale (instance crashed, network partitioned, JVM stalled), another instance reclaims the row **and runs the job again** — while the original may still be part-way through `execute()`. The claim protects the row, not your method: db-scheduler stops the stale instance from recording a result, but cannot undo side effects it has already caused. **Write `execute()` so that running the same slot twice is harmless.**
- Tasks that throw are retried per their `Schedule`; the row's `consecutive_failures` increments.

This is at-most-one *per scheduled slot*, not at-most-one ever. A daily-at-02:00 job runs once at 02:00 across the cluster; if 02:00 passes while every node is down, the missed slot is picked up by the next live node when it polls.

### Bailing out before you are taken over

Ekbatan declares an execution dead after **60 seconds** of failed heartbeats (`heartbeatInterval` x
`missedHeartbeatsLimit`, 10s x 6). The instance being replaced is not told and is not interrupted -
heartbeats are written by a housekeeper thread, so a job whose work does not touch the scheduler's
database carries on without noticing. That is how the same slot ends up running twice: not because
the original died, but because it briefly could not say that it hadn't.

A job that must not overlap itself can watch its own standing and stop first. The
`ExecutionContext` already handed to `execute(...)` carries it:

```java
@Override
public void execute(ExecutionContext ctx) {
    var health = ctx.getCurrentlyExecuting().getHeartbeatState();

    for (var invoice : invoices) {
        // 0.0 right after a successful heartbeat, 1.0 at the moment another instance may claim
        // the row. Anything above ~0.5 means contact has been lost for long enough to be worth
        // stopping over.
        if (health.getFractionDead() > 0.5) {
            LOG.warn("Heartbeats failing; stopping before another instance takes this over");
            return;
        }
        send(invoice);
    }
}
```

Returning early is a normal successful completion as far as db-scheduler is concerned, so the row is
rescheduled per its `Schedule` and the remaining work is picked up on the next run - or immediately
by whichever instance reclaims the row, since the reclaim happens regardless.

`HeartbeatState` also exposes `hasStaleHeartbeat()` and `getFailedHeartbeats()` if you would rather
branch on those.

This is cooperative, and only as good as where you place the check: it suits a job that loops over
work items, and cannot help one sitting inside a single long call. It narrows the overlap window
rather than closing it - preferring an idempotent `execute()` remains the only complete answer.

## The `scheduled_tasks` table

The module needs db-scheduler's table provisioned in your application's database. Verbatim PostgreSQL schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE scheduled_tasks (
    task_name            TEXT     NOT NULL,
    task_instance        TEXT     NOT NULL,
    task_data            BYTEA,
    execution_time       TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    picked               BOOLEAN  NOT NULL,
    picked_by            TEXT,
    last_success         TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    last_failure         TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    consecutive_failures INT,
    last_heartbeat       TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    version              BIGINT   NOT NULL,
    priority             SMALLINT,
    PRIMARY KEY (task_name, task_instance)
);

CREATE INDEX execution_time_idx        ON scheduled_tasks (execution_time);
CREATE INDEX last_heartbeat_idx        ON scheduled_tasks (last_heartbeat);
CREATE INDEX priority_execution_time_idx ON scheduled_tasks (priority DESC, execution_time ASC);
```

For the MySQL/MariaDB equivalents, see db-scheduler's [`postgresql_tables.sql`](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/tree/master/db-scheduler/src/main/resources) and [`mysql_tables.sql`](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/tree/master/db-scheduler/src/main/resources). The `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` column is db-scheduler's choice (this is the one place the framework deliberately steps off the always-`TIMESTAMP` rule — db-scheduler owns the table and its schema).

A reference migration lives in [`ekbatan-integration-tests/distributed-jobs-pg/src/test/resources/db/migration/V0001__create_scheduled_tasks.sql`](../../ekbatan-integration-tests/distributed-jobs-pg/src/test/resources/db/migration/V0001__create_scheduled_tasks.sql).

## Wiring without DI

`JobRegistry` is a builder facade over a single db-scheduler `Scheduler`:

```java
import static io.ekbatan.distributedjobs.JobRegistry.jobRegistry;
import static io.ekbatan.core.persistence.ConnectionProvider.hikariConnectionProvider;

var jobsPool = hikariConnectionProvider(jobsDataSourceConfig);

var registry = jobRegistry()
        .connectionProvider(jobsPool)
        .withJob(new DailyReportJob(reportService))
        .withJob(new HourlyCleanupJob(cleanupService))
        .pollInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .heartbeatInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
        .shutdownMaxWait(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
        .build();   // a JVM shutdown hook is installed by default

registry.start();
```

For advanced db-scheduler settings not exposed by the builder (`missedHeartbeatsLimit`, `deleteUnresolvedAfter`, custom polling strategy, etc.), `customizeScheduler(...)` runs last in `build()` and can override any of Ekbatan's defaults:

```java
var registry = jobRegistry()
        .connectionProvider(jobsPool)
        .withJob(new DailyReportJob(reportService))
        .customizeScheduler(b -> b
                .missedHeartbeatsLimit(3)
                .deleteUnresolvedAfter(Duration.ofDays(30)))
        .build();
```

`JobRegistry` auto-sizes `threads(jobs.size())` for the polling batch and swaps in `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` for workers, so per-job concurrency is governed by virtual-thread scheduling rather than a fixed thread pool.

## Wiring via DI

With the `@EkbatanDistributedJob` annotation in place, the DI integration registers each `DistributedJob` bean as a managed singleton and adds it to a `JobRegistry` configured from `application.yml`:

```yaml
ekbatan:
  jobs:
    polling-interval: PT10S
    heartbeat-interval: PT30S
    shutdown-max-wait: PT30S

  sharding:
    groups:
      - members:
          - configs:
              primary-config: { … }
              jobs-config:                 # dedicated pool for the scheduler — see next section
                jdbc-url: jdbc:postgresql://primary:5432/app
                username: app
                password: ${APP_PASSWORD}
                maximum-pool-size: 5
```

> **Durations are ISO-8601.** `PT10S` (10 seconds), `PT0.2S` (200 ms), `PT5M` (5 minutes). Spring Boot's shorthand - `10s`, `200ms` - is **not** accepted: the value is bound by Jackson's `Duration` deserializer, which calls `Duration.parse`, so a shorthand value fails at startup with `Cannot deserialize value of type java.time.Duration`.

### What the three knobs do

| Property | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `polling-interval` | **10s** (db-scheduler's) | How often each instance asks the database for due work. Sets start latency: a job due at 12:00:00 may begin at 12:00:07. |
| `heartbeat-interval` | **10s** (Ekbatan's own) | How often a *running* execution stamps `last_heartbeat`, proving it hasn't crashed. |
| `shutdown-max-wait` | **30 min** (db-scheduler's) | How long `stop()` lets in-flight executions finish before forcing termination. |

Two of those resolve to db-scheduler's own defaults when unset. **`heartbeat-interval` does not** - the framework substitutes 10 seconds where db-scheduler would use 5 minutes.

That matters because the heartbeat is not only a heartbeat. db-scheduler declares an execution dead after `heartbeatInterval x missedHeartbeatsLimit`, and that limit defaults to **6**, so:

```
Ekbatan defaults    10s  x 6 = 60 seconds   before another instance revives the job
db-scheduler's      5min x 6 = 30 minutes
```

The short window is deliberate. `EventFanoutJob` and `EventHandlingJob` are themselves `DistributedJob`s, so the scheduler carries the in-process event pipeline - and a recurring task is a **single row**, so a crashed instance freezes that whole schedule until the row is revived. Half an hour of stalled fanout is a worse outcome than an occasional early revival.

Lengthen it if your jobs run long and a duplicate costs more than a delay. The tolerated-miss count is not exposed as a property, but is reachable through the escape hatch:

```java
JobRegistry.jobRegistry()
    .heartbeatInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .customizeScheduler(b -> b.missedHeartbeatsLimit(8))   // 30s x 8 = 4 minutes; minimum is 4
```

The heartbeat is written by db-scheduler's housekeeper thread, not by the thread running your job, so a long-running `execute()` is not itself at risk of being declared dead. It takes the housekeeper stalling - a long GC pause, a saturated pool, a database that won't accept the write.

> **`shutdown-max-wait` is doubled.** db-scheduler applies it to each of its two shutdown phases - waiting politely, then waiting again after interrupting - and logs "Will wait up to 2x". On the 30-minute default that is up to an hour, which is usually worth lowering in tests. An execution still running when it expires is abandoned, leaving its row picked with a frozen heartbeat, so it is recovered later by the same path as a crash.

`JobRegistry.start()` is wired to your DI container's lifecycle (Spring `initMethod`/`destroyMethod`, Quarkus `@Observes StartupEvent`/`ShutdownEvent`, Micronaut `ApplicationEventListener<StartupEvent>`).


### Database dialect

db-scheduler needs dialect-specific SQL, and by default works out which by opening a connection at `Scheduler.create(...)` and reading `DatabaseMetaData`. If that connection fails it logs an error and keeps generic SQL **for the scheduler's lifetime**. Ekbatan's pools are built with `initializationFailTimeout = -1` so an application can start before its database is reachable, which makes that failure ordinary rather than exotic - and the generic SQL emits `OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY`, which MySQL and MariaDB cannot parse. The result would be a scheduler issuing an invalid poll query forever, while the application reports healthy.

So `JobRegistry` resolves the dialect from the pool's **JDBC URL** instead and pins it before the scheduler is created. No connection is involved, so an unreachable database at startup cannot change the outcome, and `build()` does not block waiting for one.

One assumption is worth knowing: a URL cannot reveal the server version, and db-scheduler distinguishes MySQL 8+ from older releases (they differ only in whether generic lock-and-fetch is used; both emit `LIMIT`). Ekbatan assumes **MySQL 8 or later**, matching its own migrations and examples. On an older server, override it:

```java
JobRegistry.jobRegistry()
    .customizeScheduler(b -> b.jdbcCustomization(new MySQLJdbcCustomization(false)))
```


The `ekbatan.jobs.*` properties also accept camelCase aliases: `polling-interval` / `pollingInterval`, `heartbeat-interval` / `heartbeatInterval`, and `shutdown-max-wait` / `shutdownMaxWait`.

## Use a dedicated connection pool

Use a dedicated `ConnectionProvider` for `JobRegistry` — separate from your primary application pool. db-scheduler polls continuously, so you don't want it competing with normal queries for connections. A small pool is enough (polling + heartbeats are low-volume).

The DI integrations expect this pool under the user-defined `jobs-config` / `jobsConfig` slot of the default shard's first member, as shown above. Both spellings are accepted in external config. Manual wiring must use the canonical Java key: `member.configFor("jobsConfig")`, not `member.configFor("jobs-config")`.
